# Windows 11 Compatibility Checker

A Python tool to check your computer's Windows 11 compatibility

## How to use

The script only works in Windows (you can't execute it from Windows or macOS)!

* Execute cmd.exe
* Go to the script folder using ``cd C:\path\to\the\script\folder\``
* Execute the script using ``python3 get_comp.py``
* Wait and see if your PC is compatible with Windows 11

## Issues

For the moment, I only tested the script on my computer which has an Intel Core i7-9750H and a TPM 2.0.

If you have any issue with the script, report it on the [issues page](https://github.com/DocSystem/win11compatcheck/issues/)
